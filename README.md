# Underground metabolism as a rich reservoir for pathway engineering

This repository provides all the necessary scripts and input files and both the underground and heterologous metabolic models to reproduce the results of the study. The exchange reactions of the models are set to mimic M9 glucose minimal media. The repository is divided into sections according to the result chapters in our report:
* yield_calculations
* MILP
* statistical_analysis
